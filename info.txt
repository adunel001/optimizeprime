First step was to design the GUI
Then convert the GUI design to an HTML form using CSS 
Next we write a PHP script to check the login authentication for login into the website called the Vacation Lounge. 
The php scripts are placed at the top of the pages, first, on the Index.php so that the guest is directed to the login page
Then script for the authentication is place at the top of the form such that the "form action" is pointed to thesame file "login.php".

In the script, Since we are not using a Database, a User is created and stored as a variable to be able to access the page.

And finally, after login, we also need to provide a logout link to the user, so we created a logout script on another file, logout.php.
